        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Jia-Hong Huang is a final-year computer science Ph.D. candidate at the University of Amsterdam. He received his Bachelor's degrees in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics from National Chengchi University in 2014, his first Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2016, and his second Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in 2018. Jia-Hong's research focuses on multi-modal machine learning applications, particularly on developing algorithms that can analyze and understand video, image, and text data, with applications in automatic video summarization, automatic medical report generation, and visual question answering. During his time at the University of Amsterdam, Jia-Hong has established himself as a prolific researcher and has published numerous papers in top-tier AI-related conferences such as AAAI, ICCV, CVPR, WACV, ICIP, ACCV, ICME, ICMR, ICASSP, and ICML. He has also served as a reviewer for several prestigious journals and conferences in the field. In addition to his research, Jia-Hong is an active mentor to students and has organized and participated several workshops and seminars related to machine learning. He has received various awards and fellowships, including the Government Scholarship to Study Abroad from Taiwan and the Marie Skłodowska–Curie Actions Fellowship from the European Union. After completing his Ph.D., Jia-Hong intends to pursue a career in academia or industry, where he can continue to conduct cutting-edge research in multi-modal machine learning and mentor the next generation of computer science researchers.</p>
