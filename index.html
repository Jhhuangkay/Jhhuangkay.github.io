        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Jia-Hong Huang, a final-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. I hold Bachelor's degrees in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics from National Chengchi University (2014), a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from National Taiwan University (2016), and another Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (2018). My research revolves around multi-modal machine learning applications, with a particular focus on developing algorithms to analyze and comprehend video, image, audio, and text data. I have worked on exciting projects such as automatic video summarization, automatic medical report generation, visual question answering, and active speaker detection. During my time at the University of Amsterdam, I have made contributions to the field, publishing several papers in renowned AI-related conferences like AAAI, ICCV, CVPR, WACV, ICIP, ACCV, ICME, ICMR, ICASSP, and ICML. Additionally, I actively participate as a reviewer for esteemed journals and conferences in this domain. Apart from research, I am passionate about mentoring students, and I have organized and participated in various workshops and seminars related to machine learning. Throughout my academic journey, I have been recognized with prestigious awards and fellowships, including the Government Scholarship to Study Abroad from Taiwan and the Marie Skłodowska–Curie Actions Fellowship from the European Union. After completing my Ph.D., my aspiration is to pursue a career in industry, where I can continue conducting cutting-edge research in multi-modal machine learning and inspire the next generation of computer science researchers.</p>
